**Multiplayer Supplemental Infraction Procedure Guide**

_Effective February 10, 2022_

---

# Introduction

The Multiplayer Supplemental Infraction Procedure Guide exists to assist Judges who are working at Competitive or Professional Rules Enforcement Level in Multiplayer game mode tournaments. This document is written as a supplement to the Infraction Procedure Guide and should be used in close conjunction with it and the Multiplayer Supplemental Tournament Rules. 

This document is an extension of the Infraction Procedure Guide, and therefore a person using the Multiplayer Supplement should first be familiar with that document. Once a person has reviewed the relevant sections of the Infraction Procedure Guide, they can turn to the Multiplayer Supplemental Infraction Procedure Guide to find details on how to proceed in Multiplayer Game Modes.

## Framework

Each section within this document mirrors its namesake in the Infraction Procedure Guide. Within each section, **Policy Additions** and **Edits** can be found. **Policy Additions** are policies outlined as best practice for handling infractions, penalties, and fixes. **Edits** are designed to address the few important removals or additions to this document that differ from the Infraction Procedure Guide. Items or sections with italicized text are taken directly from the Infraction Procedure Guide.

See the **Multiplayer Supplemental Tournament Rules** for further definitions of terms in this document. 

At the time of original publishing, this document has been published solely in English. If such a time exists that this document be printed, translated, or otherwise ported to another language, tournament participants must refer to the English version to settle disputes concerning interpretations.

This document is updated periodically. Please obtain the most current version [here](https://github.com/MonarchDevelopment/MIPG-and-MSTR/blob/main/MSIPG.md).

# 1. General Philosophy

**Policy Additions**

**1A.** In Multiplayer formats, due to larger match sizes and longer match lengths, the number of games played is typically one. As such, the penalty of Game Loss is effectively equivalent to the penalty of Match Loss. The application of Game Loss has been modified where appropriate. 

**1B.** In some cases, the penalty of Game Loss remains. In other cases, a new remedy and penalty have been substituted to maintain the philosophy of the Infraction Procedure Guide when the application of a Game Loss has been deemed too severe or otherwise inappropriate.

## 1.1. Definition of Penalties

**Policy Additions**

**1.1A.** In best-of-one Multiplayer game modes a Game Loss penalty would be equivalent to a Match Loss. Therefore, each penalty where a Game Loss would be applied has been updated while maintaining the purposes of mitigating advantages and disincentivizing the infraction. 

## 1.3. Randomizing a Library

**Edits**

_The remedy for some infractions in this document includes shuffling the randomized portion of the library. This requires first determining whether any portion of the library is non-random, such as cards that have been manipulated on the top or bottom of the library, and separating those. Check with **all** players to verify this, and check the graveyard, exile, and battlefield for library manipulation cards, such as Brainstorm and cards with the scry mechanic. Once the library has been shuffled, any manipulated cards are returned to their correct locations._

# 2. Game Play Errors

**Policy Additions**

_With the exception of Failure to Maintain Game State, which is never upgraded, the third or subsequent Warning for a Game Play Error offense in the same category is upgraded to a Game Loss. For multi-day tournaments, the penalty count for these infractions resets between days._

**2A.** In Multiplayer game modes, the third infraction is often not worthy of a Match Loss. It is still important, however, to discourage the infraction and mitigate the possible gained avantage. In Multiplayer matches, the fourth Warning for a Game Play Error in the same category is upgraded to a Game Loss. 

## **2.1. Game Play Error — Missed Trigger**

**Policy Additions**

_If the triggered ability isn’t covered by the previous paragraphs, the opponent<sup><strong>2.1A</strong></sup> chooses whether the triggered ability is added to the stack. If it is, it’s inserted at the appropriate place on the stack if possible or on the bottom of the stack. No player may make choices for the triggered ability involving objects that would not have been legal choices when the ability should have triggered. For example, if the ability instructs a player to sacrifice a creature, that player can't sacrifice a creature that wasn't on the battlefield when the ability should have triggered._

**2.1A.** In Multiplayer game modes, the remaining opponents must come to a majority decision on the choice. If no majority decision is reached, the final decision will be made by a randomly chosen opponent.

## 2.3. Game Play Error — Hidden Card Error

**Policy Additions**

_If a set affected by the error contains more cards than it is supposed to contain, the player reveals the set of cards that contains the excess and their opponent<sup><strong>2.3A,B</strong></sup> chooses a number of previously unknown cards sufficient to reduce the set to the correct size. These excess cards are returned to the correct location. If that location is the library, they should be shuffled into the random portion unless the owner previously knew the identity of the card/cards illegally moved; that many cards, chosen by the opponent, are returned to the original location instead…_

**2.3A** In Multiplayer game modes, the majority of remaining opponents must decide on the card(s) returned. If no majority decision is reached, the final decision will be made by a randomly chosen opponent. 

**2.3B** In Multiplayer game modes, the Upgrade for Hidden Card Error remains a Game Loss. This does mean that the player effectively receives a Match Loss.

## 2.5. Game Play Error — Game Rule Violation

**Edits**

_While Game Rule Violations can be attributed to one player, they usually occur publicly and **all** players are expected to be mindful of what is happening in the game. It is tempting to try  and “fix” these errors, but it is important that they be handled consistently, regardless of their impact on the game._

_If the game has proceeded past a point where an opponent could reasonably be expected to notice the error, the opponent has also committed an infraction. In most cases, the infraction is Game Play Error — Failure to Maintain Game State. However, if the judge believes that **multiple** players were responsible for the Game Rule Violation, such as due to the opponent **(s)** controlling the continuous effect modifying the rules of the game that led to the Game Rule Violation or a player taking action based on another player’s instruction, they have instead committed a Game Play Error — Game Rule Violation. For example, if a player casts Path to Exile on an opponent’s creature and the opponent puts the creature into the graveyard, once the game has continued **all players involved (the controller and/or owner of the objects and/or effects involved)** will have committed a Game Rule Violation._

## 2.6. Game Play Error — Failure to Maintain Game State

**Policy Additions**

**2.6A.** In Multiplayer game modes, although a warning in this category never upgrades, this infraction should be tracked so it can be referenced in investigations. A Failure to Maintain Game State can still mask cheating.

# 3. Tournament Errors

## 3.1. Tournament Error — Tardiness

**Policy Additions**

**3.1A.** In Multiplayer game modes, no Game Loss is awarded for Tardiness. Instead, players who arrive late and would normally receive a Game Loss skip their first turn. For more information on skipping turns, refer to Comprehensive Rules 500.10.

## 3.2. Tournament Error — Outside Assistance

**Policy Additions**

**_Definition_**

_A player, spectator, or other tournament participant does any of the following:_

* _Seeks play advice or private information about their match from others once they have sat for their match._
* _Gives play advice or reveals private information to players who have sat for their match._
* _During a game, refers to notes (other than Oracle™ pages) made before the official beginning of the current match._

**3.2A.** In Multiplayer game modes, this refers only to players outside of the current match. Players who offer advice or strategic lines of play to opponents within their current match have not committed Outside Assistance.

**3.2B.** In Multiplayer games modes, if the penalty for Outside Assistance is downgraded, it downgrades to a Warning instead of a Game Loss. 

## 3.3 Tournament Error — Slow Play

**Policy Additions**

**_Additional Remedy_**

_In the event that the match exceeds the time limit, two additional turns are added to the number of additional turns played. This turn extension occurs before any end-of-match procedure can begin and after any time extensions that may have been issued._

_No additional turns are awarded if the match is already in additional turns, though the Warning still applies._

**3.3A.** In Multiplayer game modes, no additional extra turns are added as a remedy for slow play. Players who receive a Slow Play warning during the round will skip any extra turns after round time is called. Their turn is not considered when determining extra turns for end of round procedure. The remaining players take their extra turns as described in the [Multiplayer Supplemental Tournament Rules (MSTR), 2.5A](https://github.com/MonarchDevelopment/MIPG-and-MSTR/blob/main/MSTR.md#25-end-of-match-procedure).

**3.3B.** If a player is issued a Warning for Slow Play after time in the round has been called, that player's turn(s) are not skipped, though the Warning still applies.

## 3.4 Tournament Error — Decklist Problem

**Policy Additions**

**3.4A** In Multiplayer game modes, the penalty for Decklist Error remains a Game Loss. This does mean that the player effectively receives a Match Loss.

## 3.5. Tournament Error — Deck Problem

**Policy Additions**

**_Additional Remedy_**

_Locate any cards missing from the deck and any incorrect cards in any game zone. Reveal those cards to the opponent<sup><strong>3.5A</strong></sup>. The opponent<sup><strong>3.5A</strong></sup> chooses which of the missing cards replaces each incorrect card; any extras are shuffled into the random portion of the library. If more cards are being removed than added, prioritize ones not in the library first. If there are still additional cards not in the library that need replacing, they are replaced by cards from the random portion of the library. If the missing card(s) are with the sideboard and it isn’t the first game, choose the ones to be returned to the deck at random from main deck cards in the sideboard._

**3.5A.** In Multiplayer game modes, the card or cards are revealed to all opponents. The majority of opponents must come to a decision on which missing card replaces each incorrect card. If no majority decision is reached, the final decision will be made by a randomly chosen opponent.  

**3.5B.** Though some of the Upgrades listed in the Infraction Procedure Guide for Deck Problem may be uncommon in Multiplayer game modes, all upgrades listed in the Infraction Procedure Guide still carry the penalty of a Game Loss. This means a player receiving this upgraded penalty effectively receives a Match Loss.

**Edits**

_If the missing card(s) were in a previous or current opponent’s deck, issue penalties to **all relevant** players._

## 3.8. Tournament Error — Marked Cards

**Policy Additions**

**3.8A.** In Multiplayer game modes, all upgrades for Marked Cards listed in the Infraction Procedure Guide still carry the penalty of a Game Loss. This means a player receiving this upgraded penalty effectively receives a Match Loss. 

# 4. Unsporting Conduct

## 4.1. Unsporting Conduct — Minor

**Policy Additions**

**4.1A.** In Multiplayer game modes, subsequent Unsporting Conduct - Minor infractions still carry the penalty of a Game Loss. This means the player effectively receives a Match Loss.

## 4.2. Unsporting Conduct — Major

**Policy Additions**

_Because of the confrontational nature of this infraction, judges need to end any match in progress and separate the players*. Care should be taken not to escalate the situation if at all possible. The offender will be removed from the area to receive the penalty, and education about why the behavior is unacceptable regardless of excuse. They may need a few moments to cool down afterwards. Apologizing is encouraged, but the desire of the other individuals to not interact with their harasser must be respected._

**4.2A.** Only the players instigating or perpetuating confrontation are removed from the match.

## 4.4. Unsporting Conduct — Bribery and Wagering

**Policy Additions**

**4.4A.** In-game agreements, such as offering to not attack one another, are not Bribery. Bribery refers to tangible, monetary, or other similar means outside of the game offered to influence or change gameplay decisions or match outcome.

**Edits**

_Examples_

1. _A player in a Swiss round offers their opponent $100 to concede the match._
2. _A player offers their opponent a card in exchange for a draw._
3. _A player asks for a concession in exchange for a prize split._
4. _Two players agree that the winner of the match will be able to choose a rare card out of the other person’s deck after the match._
5. _Two spectators place a bet on the number of games that will be needed to decide a match._
6. **A player in a Multiplayer match asks their opponent not to attack them this turn in exchange for $20.**
